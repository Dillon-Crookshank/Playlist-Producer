# Playlist-Producer

This is a full-stack web app that uses the Spotify API.

The backend uses Express.js, and the frontend uses React.js

My plan for this project is to eventually have a complete Spotify web player that can automatically add new songs to a playlist as you listen.

For now, the app is a simple web player that shows your queue.
